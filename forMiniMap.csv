767,0.9194,,,,,,,39,,"Gold torc.The torc is made of two strands of twisted gold wire continuing to form circular terminals. 

It dates from the 2nd century BC or possibly 1st century AD.  We purchased it at auction from Sotheby's in April 1960. I believe there was a contribution from the National Art Collections Fund to meet the auction price.

My file notes provide the following details: - the torc has been sampled metallurgically giving the average composition as 67.54% gold; 29.98% silver; 0.49% copper & 0.07% iron. There were just detectable traces of lead and possibly cobalt. This appears to have been an unrefined gold with no alloying additions. Some of the simple wire torcs from the Snettisham hoard are comparable. The presumed source of the Snettisham group is Gallo-Belgic coinage, starting with Gallo-Belgic A coins. The composition is at one end for the range and by the time the coinage had reached 70% gold alloying with copper had started. Metallurgically this appears to be a bit unusual though stylistically it is close to the simpler Snettisham pieces. 

I have a note of it appearing in Whitaker's History of Manchester (1872) and in Bernard Barnes' Man and the Changing Landscape (Liverpool, 1982).", Holme, Burnley, Lancashire, England, United Kingdom,Europe,,,,,,,,

The vase has a flat ring base and a rounded body, which is closed except for the neck set off-centre on top of the vase. The neck in the centre of the top of the vase is decorative, not functional -- it does not have an opening. Two handles extend from the top of the central neck to the top of the vase. The vase is decorated with red stripes or bands around the body, although the decoration is obscured by the blackened surface, probably from exposure to smoke or fire.

This type of vase is known as a 'stirrup jar', after the shape of handles; it also used to be called a 'false neck' type, since the central 'neck', where the handles attach, is closed and could not be used. These vases were used to transport valuable liquids, like olive oil.", Gurob (Kom Medinet Ghurab), Faiyum, Egypt,Africa,,,,,,,,,,

He is identified as an 'excellent spirit of Re', which was an expression for honouring some dead people. Ptah-hesy holds an ankh in his right hand and holds a lotus to his nose, with his right hand.

To the right of Ptah-hesy is another man, Pen-renut, who dedicated the stela. Pen-renut was an official in the temple known as the Ramesseum, and he holds his hands out towards Ptah-hesy in a gesture of prayer or adoration.
